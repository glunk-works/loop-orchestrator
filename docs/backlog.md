# loop-engine — Backlog

Post-migration / out-of-band ideas that are **not** part of the current
`docs/migration_roadmap.md` phases. Captured here so they aren't lost; each is a
candidate to promote into a phase/sprint plan later. Nothing here is scheduled or
committed to a design yet.

> Scope note: `docs/migration_roadmap.md` remains the authoritative record for the

> ideas beyond it.

### BL-1 — In-loop code review of the Coder's output (Architect / QA persona + gate)
*(added 2026-07-10, from repo owner)*

The default loop is `PM → Architecture → Agile Sprint Breakdown → Coder/IaC`, and
each stage passes a content **gate** (accept / revise / escalate). Today the
Coder's implementation output is gated only by its own `CoderGate` /
`RalphCoderGate` (green-test gate) — there is **no dedicated review of the sprint's
code by an Architect or QA persona** inside the loop. The only architect-level
review is the *dev-workflow* HITL step (a human Opus session reviewing a diff),
which is external to a running loop.

**Idea:** revise the flow so a completed sprint's code is reviewed by an
Architect or a new QA/Reviewer persona before the sprint is accepted — an in-loop
review stage/gate that can `revise` (route rework back to the Coder by blast
radius) or `escalate`, mirroring the existing gate ladder rather than relying
solely on the green-test gate.

**Open design questions (not yet decided):**
- New dedicated `Reviewer`/`QA` persona vs. reusing the Architect persona in a
  review role.
- Where it sits: a post-Coder review **stage** in the default loop, vs. a richer
  **gate** on the Coder stage output.
- What it reviews against: architecture-definition conformance, the Global
  Definition of Done, security invariants, diff quality.
- Interaction with the isolated multi-repo factory (`flows/maintenance` already
  gates on green tests + opens a PR — is the review the PR review, an in-loop
  stage, or both?).
- Cost/latency impact of an extra LLM review stage per sprint.

### BL-2 — Slack integration
*(added 2026-07-10, from repo owner)*

Add Slack integration to loop-engine. Scope intentionally open — candidate
surfaces to define later:
- Notifications: run started / completed / failed / budget-exceeded /
  **awaiting-issue** (the human-escalation pause is the highest-value signal —
  today it only surfaces as a filed GitHub issue).
- A trigger surface (parallel to the existing `trigger/` GitHub webhook): kick off
  a run from a Slack command/message.
- Answering escalations from Slack (route a paused run's questions to a channel
  and fold the reply back), as an alternative to the GitHub-issue round-trip.

**Open design questions:** which direction(s) first (outbound notify vs. inbound
trigger vs. escalation round-trip); credential class (a Slack token is an inbound/
outbound bot credential — distinct from the keyring-only Anthropic key and the
env-var webhook secret, per the `trigger/` precedent); whether it's a new
top-level orchestrator-level caller (sibling of `trigger/`/`flows/`) or an MCP
server.

### BL-3 — Review the prompt-caching implementation (correctness + improvement)
*(added 2026-07-10, from repo owner)*

A focused review of the Anthropic prompt-caching implementation (landed in
`sprints/11_prompt_caching/`, primarily in `tools/llm/client.py` with rate
accounting in `tools/llm/pricing.py`). Two aims:

**a. Confirm correct implementation.** Verify caching actually engages and is not
silently invalidated: the cached system prefix must be **byte-identical across
calls** (state-derived, immutable content only — findings/sprint plans/revision
history belong in the *user* turn, never the cached prefix, per the guard noted in
`sprints/DEFERRED_VERIFICATION.md` §1). Check `cache_control` breakpoint placement,
that the prefix clears Sonnet 5's ~2048-token minimum cacheable size on the
Coder/Architect stages, and that `Cache R` (cache-read) is nonzero on tool-loop
iterations and revision retries rather than always 0 (the tell-tale of a silent
invalidator). Confirm cost accounting attributes cache-read vs. cache-write tokens
at the right rates.

**b. Look for improvement opportunities.** e.g. additional/earlier cache
breakpoints, widening the cached prefix, caching across stages where the prefix is
stable, cache-TTL/ordering considerations, and any cost-model refinements. Nothing
designed yet.

**Notes / where to look:** `tools/llm/client.py` (cache-control assembly + system
blocks), `tools/llm/pricing.py` (rate table, incl. the introductory-rate caveat
through 2026-08-31), `sprints/DEFERRED_VERIFICATION.md` §1 (the caching + USD smoke
and the byte-identity guard). Part of this is a **live** check needing a real key
(the mocked suite pins exact transport call counts but cannot show real cache hits)
— fold it into the same daemon-bearing host session as the other deferred smokes.
